Introduction: WeChat has some excellent channels for lively and informative discussions focussing on blockchain technologies. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently posted a set of blockchain ‘hard questions’ to one of these, and we are publishing responses here in Medium from Penta Global as a way to extend the conversation across the wider blockchain community, with hopes of furthering the conversation and a productive exchange of ideas.

Q: PoW is burning billions of dollars per year, even more than all scams and thefts combined. Isn’t this a big tragedy?

A: Yes, indeed it is. And the electricity utilized (literally ‘burned’) for PoW does not serve any real world function other than crypto mining. Correspondingly this means there is a tremendous drain on natural resources that gives little back to the world or the people who live in it. 

Digiconomist has published their analysis of estimated annual PoW energy consumption by Bitcoin in a strikingly graphic:

Some of their key statistics from the Bitcoin data include:

* Bitcoin's current estimated annual electricity consumption > 70 TWh (Terawatt-hours)

* Annualized  estimated global mining revenues ~ USD $4.9B

* Annualized estimated global mining costs ~ USD $3.6B

* Estimated electricity used over the previous day ~ 200 GWh (Gigawatt-hours)

* Electricity consumed per transaction ~ 900 KWh

* Number of US households that could be powered by Bitcoin > 6.5 million

* Annual carbon footprint > 35 Megatonne of CO2

* Carbon footprint per transaction > 400 kg of CO2

A similar graphic is available for Ethereum:

The basic methodology for both analyses is the same:

* The total PoW mining revenues are calculated in US dollars

* The percentage of mining revenues spent on electricity are estimated ( approximately ~ 50%)

* Convert these to kWh by dividing the total electricity spend by an average price per kWh ( approximately ~ $0.10)

In our opinion and one shared by others, PoW is not a sustainable form of consensus mechanism for blockchains that wish to serve the real world economy. It also bears mentioning here that consumption of natural resources and effects on climate change are global problems that demand a coordinated, global response. Yet, we live in a world of nation- states that are often more interested in insular political issues than serving the general good of their citizens or the world. 

For us, the Blockchain Movement demonstrates that people can come together and participate in digital communities that solve real world problems. *Imagine a consensus algorithm that rewards not on the basis of electricity consumption, but on generation. A continent like Africa could then provide the energy needed (basically at zero cost) for its nations and populations that are hungering to grow and capitalise on the opportunities of the smart digital economy.*

We hope the blockchain community continues to advance its participation in solving real world problems as a core principle of the Blockchain Movement and advocate the fostering of research in developing sustainable consensus protocols as one important step forward.
